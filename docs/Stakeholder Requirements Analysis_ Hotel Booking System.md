# Stakeholder Requirements Analysis: Hotel Booking System

This document outlines the initial stakeholder requirements derived from the provided project blueprint and typical expectations for a hotel booking system. As the Business Analyst, I've identified the key needs for different stakeholders involved.

## 1. Identified Stakeholders

*   **Hotel Management/Client:** The primary business stakeholder interested in a functional, reliable booking system.
*   **Guests (End Users):** Individuals using the system to browse and book rooms.
*   **Developer (You):** Responsible for implementing the system according to the blueprint and requirements.
*   **System Maintainers (Implicit):** Future team responsible for operating and maintaining the system.

## 2. High-Level Business Goals

*   Provide a seamless online booking experience for guests.
*   Ensure reliable handling of room inventory to prevent overbooking.
*   Implement a robust and resilient booking process capable of handling failures gracefully.
*   Lay a foundation for a scalable and maintainable system architecture.

## 3. Functional Requirements (What the system must do)

*   **FR01:** Display available room types to users, including details like name, price per night, and potentially a description or image (derived from `GET /api/rooms` and `RoomType` entity).
*   **FR02:** Allow users to select a room type and initiate a booking request (derived from UI components and `POST /api/bookings`).
*   **FR03:** Process booking requests asynchronously using a Saga pattern to coordinate multiple steps (core concept of the blueprint).
*   **FR04:** Interact with an Inventory system/service (simulated) to temporarily hold a room upon request (`HoldRoom` command).
*   **FR05:** Interact with a Payment system/service (simulated) to process payment after a room is held (`ProcessPayment` command).
*   **FR06:** Confirm the booking only if both room hold and payment are successful (`BookingConfirmed` event).
*   **FR07:** Implement compensating actions (rollback) if any step in the booking process fails (e.g., release room hold if payment fails - `ReleaseRoom` command).
*   **FR08:** Provide users with real-time feedback on the status of their booking request (e.g., Submitted, Room Held, Payment Processing, Confirmed, Failed) (derived from SignalR integration).
*   **FR09:** Store booking details and the current state of the booking Saga (derived from `BookingState` entity).
*   **FR10:** Provide an API endpoint for users to check the status of a specific booking (`GET /api/bookings/{bookingId}/status`).
*   **FR11:** The system must be pre-populated with initial room type data for demonstration and testing (derived from seeding requirement).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements (How the system must perform)

*   **NFR01: Reliability:** The booking workflow must be highly reliable, ensuring data consistency even if parts of the process fail (addressed by Saga pattern).
*   **NFR02: Responsiveness:** The user interface must provide immediate feedback upon booking submission and real-time updates on status changes (addressed by SignalR).
*   **NFR03: Maintainability:** The system codebase must follow Clean Architecture principles for ease of understanding and modification.
*   **NFR04: Scalability:** The underlying architecture (event-driven, potential microservices) should be designed to handle future growth in load (implied by RabbitMQ/MassTransit).
*   **NFR05: Usability:** The guest-facing UI must be simple and intuitive for browsing rooms and initiating bookings.

## 5. Technical Constraints & Considerations (From Blueprint)

*   **TC01:** Backend technology stack: .NET (ASP.NET Core), EF Core.
*   **TC02:** Frontend technology stack: React (TypeScript, Vite), Zustand, Axios.
*   **TC03:** Messaging infrastructure: RabbitMQ with MassTransit for Saga orchestration.
*   **TC04:** Real-time communication: SignalR.
*   **TC05:** Database: PostgreSQL or SQL Server Express.
*   **TC06:** Architecture: Clean Architecture.

## 6. Assumptions

*   Authentication and user management are out of scope for Phase 1-3.
*   Payment processing and inventory management are simulated initially.
*   Detailed UI design specifics are flexible beyond the basic components mentioned.
*   Hotel staff administrative functions (managing rooms, viewing all bookings) are out of scope for this initial phase.

This analysis forms the basis for the more detailed requirement documents (Use Cases, User Stories, Feature List) to follow.
